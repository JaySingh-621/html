   <p>
     First grab as much slices of bread  as you would like and lay them out. Put mayo on your slices and then put the meat on one. Then put the cheese and the lettuce and tomatoes, as well as the onions. You can add more fillings and slices of bread if you would like but at the end make sure to close it with a final piece of bread. Finally you should heat it up on the stove or in a microwave.

</ul>
   <p>
     This is one of the most important parts. Make sure to put away all the ingredients that you used and also to clean up any messes that were made. Also make sure to turn off the heat source that was used to heat the sandwich. 
  </p>

   
   <p>
     After all of this is done, then you can finally enjoy your sandwich.
